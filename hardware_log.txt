10/11/2019 - Received hardware from department: RPi Zero, resistors, camera, ultrasonic sensors
           - Bought microSD for Raspbian download
10/12/2019 - Set up RPi Zero with camera and sensors
           - Each sensor needs a 1K and 2K resistor to work with RPi (5V -> 3V)
           - Camera works, can read sensor signals
           - Tried ultrasonic test code, did not calculate correct distances
           - Wrote new function for sensor distance measurement using sleep to calculate time elapsed
           - Tested all sensors with new distance function, none returned accurate distance measurements
           - Tried Arduino with new cables, USB client port not responding? :(
10/13/2019 - Sensor debugging: - increased sleep time between measurements
                               - tried different trig/echo pins
                               - used old time.time() function
                               - cleaning up gpio after each measurement
                               - printing all signals from echo pin
           - Measurements still inaccurate ???
10/15/2019 - Tested sensors with new wires at meeting, did not work
           - Set up VNC on RPi, can be used with laptop + ethernet
10/17/2019 - Received camera screen from Brad.
10/20/2019 - Purchased Raspberry Pi 4
           - Sensors work with new Pi
10/21/2019 - Alpha release
           - Pi camera stopped working
           - Ordered new camera
