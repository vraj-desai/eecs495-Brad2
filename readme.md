Back Me Up - BRAD 2

For beta realease, we have implemented the whole system integrated with an on/off button. 

The camera displays a live video feed with boxes around objects. The object detection program is trained to detect different objects in each frame such as sofa, bottles, people, etc. There are also three distance readings on the screen, which is from the ultrasonic sensors calculating the distances of the closest objects. 

To run our program, use the following command:

 python3 button.py

Our program requires at least one video input device such as a camera or webcam connected to the device it's runnnin on.
